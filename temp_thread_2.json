The committed file acts as a pre-seeded cache. Since `fetchProjectData` checks `mtimeMs` against `Date.now()`, the committed file's mtime on a fresh clone will be the clone time, which will be within the 10-minute TTL — so it will be used as cache on first run after clone, even though it may be days or weeks old.\n2. Every time the cache refreshes, it modifies a tracked file, creating unintended git diffs. Developers will see `.cache_project_schema.json` as modified in `git status` after running any command that triggers a cache refresh.\n\nThis file should likely be in `.gitignore` rather than committed.\n\n<!-- devin-review-badge-begin -->\n<a href=\"https://app.devin.ai/review/lofi-monk/lofipulse/pull/40\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://static.devin.ai/assets/gh-open-in-devin-review-dark.svg?v=1\">\n    <img src=\"https://static.devin.ai/assets/gh-open-in-devin-review-light.svg?v=1\" alt=\"Open in Devin Review\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n<!-- devin-review-badge-end -->\n\n---\n*Was this helpful?
