# Current Focus

We are in **EXECUTION** mode for **Issue #1: Project Initialization & CI Setup**.

1.  **Initialize Node.js** (`npm init`).
2.  **Install Dependencies** (`typescript`, `vitest`, `biome`, `husky`, `lofi-gate`).
3.  **Setup CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/gate.yml`).

# Recent Decisions

- [x] **Trunk-Based Development:** Feature branches merge to `main` via linear `squash`.
- [x] **Strict TDD:** Lofi Gate must be active (`strict_tdd = true`) before feature code.
- [x] **No "Dev" Branch:** `main` is protected and deployable.
- [x] **Project Management:** All work must have a GitHub Issue and be tracked on the Kanban board.
