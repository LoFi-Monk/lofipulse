## License

**GNU GPLv3**

LoFiPulse is built on the philosophy of open collaboration. We have chosen the GNU GPLv3 license to ensure that this tool remains free and open for everyone to use, study, and improve.

### Why GPLv3?

- **Reciprocity:** We believe that if you benefit from the community's work, you should share your improvements back with the community.
- **Protection:** This license provides a "patent shield," protecting both the contributors and the users from patent litigation.
- **Respect for Dependencies:** As this project integrates various open-source libraries and is developed with the assistance of AI agents, the GPLv3 provides the most robust framework to ensure we stay in compliance with the open-source ecosystem.

### Can I use this commercially?

**Yes.** You are free to use LoFiPulse for commercial purposes, including building and selling services on top of it. However, if you distribute the software (or a modified version of it), you must provide the source code to your users under the same GPLv3 license.

> “Keep it open, keep it honest, keep it LoFi.”
